###Java basics
Android uses Java as programming language and we should now it. Here we consider not the real basics of Java, but the really necessary for Android things, such as OOP, anonymous inner clasess, event-oriented programming, reflection, annotations, etc.


###Android basics
Very intro to Android development: IDE, tools, basic topics for Android: Activities, Fragments, creating user interface, widgets, project structure, resources and etc.


###Android fundamentals
We are going deeper to Android development. And we'll look at adapters, databases, gestures and animations, services and broadcast receivers and many other things.


###Material design
Materail design is a new design philosophy from Google and today any app should implement it. We'll figure out how to create apps with material design and learn principals of the material design, new widgets, animations framework and how to support everything on API < 21.


###Client-server applications
Client-server applications is the most popular type of apps, so this is the most important and the biggest course. We'll learn how to create client side of client-server application "out-of-the-box", how to create and arhictecture of such an app. We'll also look for many libraries which could help us, such as Volley, Retrofit and etc. And we'll understand how to manage with server side using different abilities, such as Spring, Google Cloud and etc.


###Android concurrency
Android unlike Java has many new classes for providing good concurrency and we'll see them all - from Threads to Executors, from AsyncTasks to IntentServices and etc. And more important - we'll discuss problems of concurrency.


###Android data
Storing users data is very important part of any application, and we'll look every opportunity - from SharedPreferences to complex ORM databases.


###Kotlin
Kotlin is a new language from JetBrains, which is absolutely compatible with Java, but much more easy and pleasant to use. This language could use any feature from Java and has many own, such us extension functions, null-safety and many others. We'll look how to use Kotlin to create great Android app.


###Android Wear
Today many users also has smartwatches. And if you want your app to be always in use, you should adapt it for Android Wear. We'll also discuss how to build complex notifications and manage communication between handheld and wear.


###Game development
Gamedev is very special part of Android development, but we'll see it also. We'll look for "out-of-the-box" opportunities, such as SurfaceView and OpenGL ES. More important, we'll understand how to create a good architecture for our game applying MVC pattern. And we'll also look at two most popular and powerful libraries - AndEngine and libGDX. Moreover, we'll use Unity as well.


###Android patterns
Java is a language of design patterns. Android is even more. You have to understand principals of building good architecture to create powerful and scalable Android apps. We'll figure out many with patterns from Gang of Four and others. 


###Android security
Security is a very important thing today. We must protect our users data. We'll discuss how to provide encryption of data and where and how store you application files.


###Android testing
Automatic tests provides us ability to easy understand was last changes sucessful or net and find many bugs. We'll consider many testing framework, such us Robotium, Robolectric, Espresso. We'll also look for dependency injection.


###Android functional reactive programming
There are many paradigms of programming, such as OOP, functional paradigm and etc. Android after Java uses OOP, but it possible to add some functional things to your code - and we'll understand how to do it. We'll concentrate on extremely powerful library RxJava and its Android version - RxAndroid.
